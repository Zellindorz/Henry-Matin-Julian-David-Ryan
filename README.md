# mini-games-template
Each person in the group will be responsible for creating a completely different mini game based on the story or theme the group agrees upon. Each person needs to integrate the following topics into their mini game:

- Compound shapes
- Animation
- Drawing using a loop
- Use of lists

## Contributions
Every member MUST commit their changes to GitHub (perhaps in their own file) **every day**. 40% of the mark will be based on daily commits and proper commit messages. The other 60% will be inclusion of the above topics. You may use any resource available to you with the exception of copying another game from the Internet and having someone write your code for you.
